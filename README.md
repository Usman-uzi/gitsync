# GitSync
A tool for those who work in lots of repositories at once

## What is GitSync?

GitSync is a tool I made a while ago to support working in multiple repositories and doing mass tasks like pulling all repo's, checking what branches you are on across all repo's, checking any repo's that have pending changes and so on.

Right now this is a single messy, poorly documented single-code-file project but it does the job. I will clean this up and improve it in future.

## Using GitSync

To use GitSync clone and build the solution, then right-click the Install project and select Build to create an MSI installer. Install that and you will have a **GitSync** shortcut in your start menu to run GitSync as well as you can start GitSync from any folder by typing `gitsync` into the address bar.

From there you can run the built-in commands. 

For now this is the only documentation on using it until I get time to spend on this project making a more formal documentation, better code comments and supporting website etc...
